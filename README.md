Basically just a copy-paste of my rentry page: Pixelated Pathways at: https://rentry.org/Pixelated_Pathways

# Pixelated Pathways

# -> 🚧 !WIP <-

!!! warning
    This page is a WIP (work in progress) and is a bit disorganized and all over the place. Bear with me, I am working on this.

!!! info
    Welcome to %#ACBDEF% **"Pixelated Pathways!"** %% The go-to place for internet stuff. Some links, some guides and some [`spider webs`](https://youtu.be/sHzdsFiBbFc?si=LLJRmNoHTf27Zn0J). I like free stuff and open-source stuff, so most of what is included on this page carries these attributes.

!!! note
    NOTE: Although this page mostly consists of unordered style lists, there had been thought and effort put into them so you can say they are somewhat curated, so work your way through from start > finish.

### ->  💯 Purpose <-

!!! note
    I would say that for me, the purpose of this page is to share information and links and to also act as a point of quick reference if you need something. Everything (well most) of what is included on this page I have used and or are using, so I would say that it is somewhat curated by experience. 
!!! note
	The info/links on this page is semi organized (what's included and what I want to still implement is very broad so this becomes a bit difficult) but I would suggest either Use the "Table of Contents" to see and quickly navigate to what you want or take some time and explore the entire page! (You never know you might end up learning something new or discover something useful!)
